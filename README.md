  👋🏻 Greetings! My full name is Irfan Zharauri Nanda Sudiyanto, and you may call me "Irfan" or "Zara. I’m a student majoring in Information Technology, with a strong passion for both Games Development and Web Development.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  🌱 From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by games, leading me to pursue coding and game design. Creating engaging, joyful experiences through games has always been my calling.

  <br/>

  🌐 My interest in web development has also grown, allowing me to craft visually appealing and functional websites. I love combining creativity and technology to build applications that leave a lasting impact.

  <br/>

  💫 I’m excited to continue growing in both fields and contributing to projects that bring happiness and value to others.
